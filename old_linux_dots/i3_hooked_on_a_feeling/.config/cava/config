[input]

# method of capturing audio, supported input methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
# Defaults to 'alsa'
#
# for pulseaudio 'source' wil be the source. Default: 'NULL', which uses system default source
# all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them
# but the default, might be your microphone, try the command 'pacmd list-sources' to find the right one
# you can change source here to the name of your prefered device, or cahnge your default pulseaudio source by running
# 'pacmd set-default-source NAME|#N'
# 
# for alsa 'source' will be the capture device. Default: 'hw:Loopback,1'
# for fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file. Default: '/tmp/mpd.fifo'

[output]

[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires a

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported, background must also be defined in hex

# not able to restore color definitions on exit, simply restart your terminal to restore colors.

[smoothing]

# multiplier for the integral smoothing calculations. Takes values from 0 - 0.99.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
; integral = 0.7 

# disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing". Default: 1. Set to 0 to disable.
; monstercat = 1 

# Set gravity multiplier for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster. 
# Accepts only non-negative values. 0.5 means half gravity, 2 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
; gravity = 1  


# In bar height, bars that whould have been lower that this will not be drawn.
; ignore = 0 


[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want. 
# remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
 1 = 2    # bass
 2 = 2

 4 = 1
 5 = 0.5  # treble
